#Configuration -> Title filtering

![Title filtering icon](images/titlefiltericon.png)<br>

Selecting this option will open a grid showing all of the installed titles on your 3DS. The cart will not be showing in this menu. Selecting any of the titles will toggle the tick in the bottom right corner of the title icon. Titles which are ticked will be shown in title menus such as Save Manager and the title launcher. Those titles which do not have a tick will not be displayed in these menus. Be default, all of the titles are enabled.
