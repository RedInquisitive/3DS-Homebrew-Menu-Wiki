#Background title loading

![Background title loading icon](wiki/images/backgroundtitleloadingicon.png)<br>

If enabled, the title menu will be populated in a background thread. This means the icons will appear in real-time, allowing you to open and close the menu and select titles before the loading process has been completed.

Please note that on some devices, such as old 3DS models, enabling this option may result in instability due to the load required to operate the title loading function in the background.
