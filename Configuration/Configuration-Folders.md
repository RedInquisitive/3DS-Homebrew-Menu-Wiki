#Folders

Gridlauncher supports separation of your homebrew apps and shortcuts into subfolders. The standard homebrew folder, /3ds, will be shown by default. This can be disabled if it is not used in the [grid options](Configuration-Grid-Options).

Additional folders can be created by making subdirectories within /gridlauncher/folders. When Gridlauncher is opened, this folder will be created if it does not already exist. These subfolders will then be shown in the folder selection screen. For example, creating a folder in /gridlauncher/folders/Games will result in a Games folder showing in the folder selection screen.

Once subfolders have been created, homebrew apps and shortcuts can be added to them in the same way they would be added to the /3ds folder.

The folder selection screen can be opened by selecting the icon in the bottom right corner of the main grid. From this screen, you can select which folder you want to view. The launcher will remember which folder was last selected and this folder will be displayed the next time the launcher is opened (or when quitting back to the launcher from a launched app or title).

Folders support the addition of [SMDH icon files](Configuration-SMDH) and [banners](Banners). If these are not present, the name of the folder and a default folder icon will be displayed.
