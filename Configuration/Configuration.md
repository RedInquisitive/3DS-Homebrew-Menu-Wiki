#Configuration

Gridlauncher configuration settings can be accessed by selecting the button in the top right corner of the main grid. The launcher provides a wide range of settings which are explained in more detail in the configuration sections on the sidebar. All of these settings are saved in the file /gridlauncher/hbl.cfg. Please note that settings related to themes are stored in separate files within the themes themselves. This is so that settings specific to themes can be switched according to which theme is selected, and shared with other users without affecting their main Gridlauncher settings.
