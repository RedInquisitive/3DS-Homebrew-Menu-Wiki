#Themes -> Icon Overlays
Grid icons can be customised with overlay images. This includes the icon for the cart launcher. Icon overlay files must all be PNG format and should be placed within the theme directory. They can contain transparency, and this is recommended for the best visual effect (such as rounded corners).
