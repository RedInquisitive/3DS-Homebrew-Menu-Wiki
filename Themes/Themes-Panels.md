#Panel options

![Panels icon](panelsicon.png)<br>

Panels are drawn behind text on the top screen, and behind the paging controls on the bottom screen. They help to make these elements of the interface clearer when using certain combinations of colours and wallpapers. For example, light text can be difficult to read on light wallpapers; a panel will make this easier to read.

The theme settings contain individual pages for adjusting the panels on the top and bottom screens. Both screens contain the following settings:
* **Translucency:** the extent to which the panel will be transparent. A higher level will make the panel more opaque and thus cause the background to be obscured to a greater extent
* **RGB sliders:** allows the colour of the panel to be adjusted to any colour you wish to mix

In addition, the panel settings for the top screen include a left edge offset setting. This allows you to prevent the panel from overlapping the icon of the selected grid item. On certain pages (such as text alerts) this setting will be ignored so that the text does not overlap the panel.
