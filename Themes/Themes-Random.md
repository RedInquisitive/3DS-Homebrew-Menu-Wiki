#Random themes

![Random themes icon](images/randomthemeicon.png)<br>

This option can be found in two places.

* In the theme selection grid where you choose which theme you want to use, there is an option to load a random theme each time Gridlauncher is opened (e.g. when launching your homebrew exploit or exiting back to the launcher from a homebrew app)
* In the main theme settings grid, there is an option to randomise the theme when the 3DS lid is closed and re-opened. Please note that this option will only take effect if the option detailed above is enabled.
