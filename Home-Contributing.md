When logging issues, please do not just post the issue you are having. I.e. please do not post "the launcher is crashing." It is impossible to diagnose and fix bugs with such limited information. To investigate reported issues, I need ALL of the following information:

* 3DS version (New/Old, XL/normal)
* 3DS region (EUR/USA/JAP/AUS.....)
* Precise FW version
* HB entrypoint used (Cubic Ninja, OOT, homemenuhax, Ironfall.....)
* Hax version (1.1/2.0/2.1/2.5)
* What exactly the problem is and how it can be reproduced

Issues with the updater program should be posted at https://github.com/ihaveamac/mashers-gl-updater/issues
