#Translucency options

![Translucency icon](translucencyicon.png)<br>

Various elements of the Gridlauncher interface can be drawn with adjustable translucency to improve the visual effect.

The theme settings contain individual pages for adjusting the translucency of objects on the top and bottom screens.

##Top screen translucency settings
* **Top bar:** The status bar at the top of the screen showing the time and/or date
* **Water:** The still water image optionally shown on the top screen. Note that this setting does not yet affect animated water
* **App icon shadow:** The shadow drawn under the icon for the selected grid item on the top screen

##Bottom screen translucency settings
* **Bottom bar:** The status bar at the top of the screen showing the title of the current page
* **Tool bar icon backgrounds:** The background images for the corner icons. This setting has no effect if the theme contains custom images for these icons
* **App backgrounds:** The borders surrounding grid icons and the placeholders for empty grid positions. This setting has no effect if the theme contains custom app background images
* **Paging controls:** The left and right arrows which can be used for changing grid pages using the touch screen
* **Toolbar icon symbols:** The symbols shown on top of the corner icons (e.g. the arrow on the back button). This setting has no effect if the theme contains custom app background images
