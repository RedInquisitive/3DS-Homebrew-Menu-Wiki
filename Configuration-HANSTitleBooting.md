#HANS Title Booting

![HANS title booting icon](hanstitlebooticon.png)<br>

If this setting is enabled, Gridlauncher will use HANS to boot any title selected, including the cart. This setting does not apply to homebrew apps (which will not boot using HANS) or HANS shortcuts (which always boot using HANS).

If HANS is not present in /gridlauncher/hans when this option is toggled, an error will be displayed specifying that HANS needs to be installed first. If you install the launcher according to the instructions on this Wiki, then HANS will already be included in the required location.

If you wish to override this setting for a particular app, highlight the app and then press the SELECT button. You will then be presented with a menu from which you can choose to boot the title using HANS or Region4.
