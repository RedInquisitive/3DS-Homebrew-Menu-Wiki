#Region Free Launcher

The Region Free Launcher allows you to load cart-based games from within Gridlauncher. If this setting is disabled, the cart icon will not be displayed on the main grid along with your homebrew apps and shortcuts. Note that the cart will always be displayed in title menus regardless of whether this option is enabled or disabled.
