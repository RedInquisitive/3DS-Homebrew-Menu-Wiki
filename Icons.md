Locations and naming conventions for the icon files are as follows:
* For theme icons, name the file 'theme.smdh' and place it inside the theme folder (e.g. '/gridlauncher/themes/mytheme/theme.smdh')
* For folder icons, name the file 'folder.smdh' and place it inside the folder (e.g. '/gridlauncher/folders/myfolder/folder.smdh')
