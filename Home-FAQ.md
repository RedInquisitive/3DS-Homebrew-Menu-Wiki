#### How do I make a theme?

See [this page](Themes) located in this wiki. It has EVERYTHING you would ever want to know about themes. If you are simply looking for other users themes, https://gbatemp.net/threads/mashers-homebrew-launcher-mod-custom-themes-thread.399333/ is a great place to start!

#### Where are my themes located?
- sdmc:/gridlauncher/themes/Default <- Default theme folder.
- sdmc:/gridlauncher/themes/(Your totally awesome theme name) <- Custom theme folder.

#### Why won't the online updater show up in my launcher? What folder should I place the updater?

Download launcher.zip from the repository root and extract it to your SD card's root. Then, run the updater. It should fix the updater not appearing AND give you the most current version. An auto updater is also included in the grid launcher folder of this repository.

#### Why do themes not shuffle on wake?

You have to use *hax 2.5, sorry. The wake feature relies on the pause of code execution that happens when the 3DS sleeps.

#### Why is mashers so awesome?

Because he is! (Really, he has worked very hard on the project!)

#### This didn't answer my question!

You will have to ask it here then. We won't bite (unless it has been asked many times before). https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-homebrew-launcher-with-grid-layout.397527/

#### People ask (insert question here) all the time! How can I add it here? and There is a seplling error, can you fix it?

Fork this repository here (https://github.com/RedInquisitive/3DS-Homebrew-Menu-Wiki) and add your question or fix. Then, create a pull request. If @mashers likes it, he will put it here as well.
